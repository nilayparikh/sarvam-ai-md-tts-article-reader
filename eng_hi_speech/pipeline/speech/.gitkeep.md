# Speech Output Directory

This directory contains generated audio files from TTS conversion.

## Files

MP3 files are generated with the naming convention:

```
{original_filename}_{timestamp}.mp3
```

Example: `article-1_20250208_143022.mp3`

## Cleanup

Audio files can be safely deleted when no longer needed.
They will be regenerated on new TTS requests.
